# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION {#ref-results}

## Model Selection

Stage 1 of model selection resulted in a significant reduction in the number of covariates. For Atlantic Cod, sea surface temperature (SST) was identified as a significant covariate in the Winter and Spring, in addition depth (Dep) and stratification were also significant predictors in the Spring. In the Fall no covariates had a WAIC that were a significant improvement from the intercept only model (Figure \@ref(fig:diag-1-fe)). Further model selection indicated that an additive Dep + SST model was the preferred model in all 3 seasons for Atlantic Cod (Figures \@ref(fig:diag-2-fe) and \@ref(fig:diag-3-fe)). When exploring the effect of temporal variability on the random fields, the models using the 5-year random field had the lowest WAIC in all seasons (Figure \@ref(fig:diag-rf)).

For Yellowtail Flounder, stage 1 of model selection indicated that the inclusion of Dep significantly improved the models in all 3 seasons (surveys), while Sediment type (Sed) and chlorophyll concentration (Chl) in the Fall had a similar impact on the model WAIC as Dep. As a result SST, Dep, Chl, and Sed were used to explore the development of more complex covariate models. For Yellowtail Flounder the best models in stage 2 of model selection included 2 covariates with a combination of Dep, SST, and Sed (Figure \@ref(fig:diag-2-fe)). Further model selection indicated that the preferred model for Yellowtail Flounder in all 3 seasons was an additive model including Dep, SST, and Sed (Figure \@ref(fig:diag-3-fe)). When exploring the effect of temporal variability on the random fields, the 3-year field had the lowest WAIC in the Winter and Spring, while the 5-year field had the lowest WAIC in the Fall (Figure \@ref(fig:diag-rf)).

## Environmental Variables

The spatial fields for the three environmental variables retained by model selection are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:SST-Dep-Sed). The average SST between 1997 and 2008 had the largest effect on the OP of Atlantic Cod; they were more likely to be found in regions of the bank with a lower SST (Figure \@ref(fig:cod-fe)). For all 3 surveys the OP of Atlantic Cod declined rapidly in regions of the bank where the SST was above approximately 10Â°C (Figure \@ref(fig:cod-fe)). Although the Dep relationship was also retained in the final Atlantic Cod model the effect of Dep on OP was substantially smaller than the SST effect. During the Winter and Spring the OP peaked between `r c.dep.peak` m and declined slowly in shallower and deeper waters (Figure \@ref(fig:cod-fe)). There was no clear relationship with Dep in the Winter.

For Yellowtail Flounder, Dep had the largest effect on OP, with Yellowtail Flounder most likely to be observed between depths of `r yt.dep.peak` m in each of the 3 surveys and the Dep effect on OP was highest during the Spring (Figure \@ref(fig:yt-fe)). The average SST between 1997 and 2008 was also included in the final model for all three seasons, with Yellowtail Flounder OP generally declining as SST increased. The effect of SST was least pronounced in the Fall. The sediment type also had a significant influence on the OP for Yellowtail Flounder in the Winter and Fall, with Sand and Gravel-Sand having higher OPs than the Other sediment category, this difference is most notable during the Winter (Figures \@ref(fig:diag-3-fe) and \@ref(fig:yt-fe)).

## Random Fields

The 5-year random fields for Atlantic Cod in the Winter and Spring are seasonally consistent through time, with lower effect sizes observed in both seasons starting in 1992 and the largest declines in the effect size observed in the southern and western portions of GB (Figures \@ref(fig:rf-winter-cod) - \@ref(fig:rf-spring-cod)). In the Fall the higher effect sizes were generally observed towards the north and in Canadian waters, with larger declines in the random field effect size towards the west over the study period (Figure \@ref(fig:rf-fall-cod)).

The Yellowtail Flounder 3-year random field patterns were similar between the seasons although the random field effect sizes were somewhat smaller during the Fall (Figures \@ref(fig:rf-winter-yt) - \@ref(fig:rf-fall-yt) ). The effect size of the random fields, in all seasons, were lower throughout the later half of the 1980s and the early 1990s. The highest effect size of the random fields were observed in the 1970s and in the 2000s. Since the mid-1970s an area straddling the Canadian-U.S. border has been consistently identified as an area where the Yellowtail Flounder effect size of the random field is elevated (Figures \@ref(fig:rf-winter-yt) - \@ref(fig:rf-fall-yt)).

The standard deviation (SD) of the random fields for Atlantic Cod were also similar between seasons with the lowest SD generally observed in the north and east and highest approaching the southern flank of GB. The SD was somewhat higher in the Fall throughout the central portion of GB (Figures \@ref(fig:rf-winter-cod-sd) - \@ref(fig:rf-fall-cod-sd)). For Yellowtail Flounder, the SD was higher towards the southern portions of the bank with localized regions having elevated SD scattered throughout the bank in the Winter, Spring and Fall. (Figures \@ref(fig:rf-winter-yt-sd) - \@ref(fig:rf-fall-yt-sd)).

## Model Predictions

The modelled OP for Atlantic Cod in the Winter and Spring was elevated on all but the most southern portion of GB in the 1970s and 1980s, in the early 1990s there was an abrupt decline in the OP throughout much of the U.S. portion of GB, while OP remained elevated in Canadian waters and in the area straddling the ICJ line (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-cod) - \@ref(fig:pf-spring-cod)). In the Fall the core areas were isolated to the north of GB. An area on the northwest of GB had some core area until the early 1980s but the OP in this area declined steadily after this time and has had a low OP in the Fall for over 20 years, the highest OP areas remaining during the Fall are along the northern edge of the bank and mostly in Canadian waters (Figure \@ref(fig:pf-fall-cod)).

The modelled OP patterns for Yellowtail Flounder on GB are similar in Winter, Spring, and Fall with core area consistently observed in the region straddling the ICJ line in each season and throughout the study period (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-yt) - \@ref(fig:pf-fall-yt)). A second region along the western border of the bank also has an elevated OP and appears to be connected via a narrow band of varying width to the core area straddling the ICJ line. The core area of Yellowtail Flounder declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was relatively stable until 2016 (Figure \@ref(fig:pf-fall-yt)).

The SD of the Atlantic Cod prediction field in the Winter and Spring tended to be elevated in the central portion of the bank, and lowest in the south and along the edges of the prediction domain. In the Fall the Atlantic Cod prediction field SD was lowest in the south, with the low SD area expanding to central regions later in the study period (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-cod-sd) - \@ref(fig:pf-fall-cod-sd)). For Yellowtail Flounder, the SD was consistently low in the part of the region with a core area that straddled the ICJ line in the Winter, Spring and Fall (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-yt-sd) - \@ref(fig:pf-fall-yt-sd)). Areas surrounding this region displayed an increase in the SD, while a region in the north and along the southern flank of GB had relatively low SDs; these regions also had relatively low OPs (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-yt) - \@ref(fig:pf-fall-yt) and \@ref(fig:pf-winter-yt-sd) - \@ref(fig:pf-fall-yt-sd)).

## Inter-annual and Seasonal Variability

For both stocks their core areas shifted towards the north and east throughout the study period, this was most noticeable when focusing on the core area (OP $\geq$ `r hi.prob`) regions (Figure \@ref(fig:cog-hep)). For Atlantic Cod the shift in distribution of the core area regions occurred relatively rapidly in the 1990s and the centre of gravity (COG) has been relatively stable since this period (Figure \@ref(fig:cog-hep)). In the 1970s and 1980s, core area was observed across the bank, however since the mid-1990s there is a clear shift in distribution with core area concentrated along the north-east of the bank mainly in Canadian waters (Figures \@ref(fig:pf-winter-cod) -\@ref(fig:pf-fall-cod)). In addition, in the Fall, Atlantic Cod has tended to be distributed along the northern edge of GB and the distribution of Atlantic Cod during this time likely includes the northern slope of the bank where there is limited survey coverage. The size of the core area has followed a similar temporal pattern as the distribution, with a rapid decline in the core area for Atlantic Cod occurring in the 1990s in the Winter and Spring (Figure \@ref(fig:area-hep)). In the Fall the decline in the size of the core area was observed approximately a decade earlier than in the Winter or Spring and the core area has been much smaller in the Fall (Figure \@ref(fig:area-hep)). Given the location of the stock along the edge of the bank during the Fall it is likely that a substantial portion of the stock is located along the slope where survey coverage is limited (Figure \@ref(fig:Overview)).

The Yellowtail Flounder shift in core area has, in large part, resulted from a reduction in the core area along the southern flanks of GB. The core area has been consolidated in a central region of GB that straddles the ICJ line dividing Canada and the U.S (Figure \@ref(fig:cog-hep)). The COG of Yellowtail Flounder has been relatively stable both seasonally and between eras since the 1990s despite large changes in the size of the core area during this time. The trends in, and size of, the core area during the Spring and Fall have been very similar since the 1980s. In both seasons there were large increases in core area in the 1990s followed by a variable, yet generally increasing, size of core area more recently (Figure \@ref(fig:area-hep)). In the Winter an area of similar location and size is observed, but the size of the core area in the Winter has been in decline since a period of increase in the 1990s (Figure \@ref(fig:area-hep)).

For both stocks the changes in the size of the core area were larger in the U.S. than in Canadian waters (Figure \@ref(fig:area-can-vs-us-hep)). In the U.S. the declines in the size of core area of Atlantic Cod occurred rapidly in the early 1990s in the Winter and Spring. In the Fall the loss of core area occurred approximately a decade earlier, although the size of the core area in the U.S. during the Fall was always substantially lower than in the Winter or Spring. In Canada there has been minimal change in the size of the core area in any of the seasons through time; the size of the core area in the Fall has tended to be lower than observed in the Winter or Spring (Figure \@ref(fig:area-can-vs-us-hep)). The size of the core area of Yellowtail Flounder in the U.S. declined steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, this was followed by an increase in the 1990s and early 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:area-can-vs-us-hep)). In the last decade the size of the core area in the U.S. appeared to stabilize. In Canada the size of core area for Yellowtail Flounder throughout the 1970s and 1980s was variable and relatively low, but in the mid-1990s the size of the core area increased and has been relatively stable since the late 1990s (Figure \@ref(fig:area-can-vs-us-hep)).

## Model Hyperparameters

For Atlantic Cod, the estimate for the variance of Dep variance hyperparameter was highest in Winter and declined through to the Fall, reflecting the decline in the influence of this covariate in the Fall (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-dep-var-est)). For Yellowtail Flounder, the variance of the Dep hyperparameter was higher than observed for Atlantic Cod throughout the year and reflected the relative stability in the effect size of this covariate throughout the year (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-dep-var-est)). The SST variance hyperparameter for Atlantic Cod was relatively stable throughout the year and reflects the consistent influence of the SST covariate on the distribution of cod. For Yellowtail Flounder, the SST variance hyperparameter was relatively low throughout the year and aligns with the consistent small effect of the SST covariate on the distribution of Yellowtail Flounder (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-sst-var-est)). The uncertainty of these estimates precludes any statistical differences being observed between the seasons.

The decorrelation range for Atlantic Cod was above 100 km throughout the year and was generally higher than that observed for Yellowtail Flounder (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-range-var-est)). The range was highest for Atlantic Cod in the Spring with an estimate of `r range.spring.cod.mn.ci` km while the range during the Winter spawning period was the lowest at `r range.winter.cod.mn.ci` km. In the Fall the estimate declined from the Spring; the range in this period may be influenced by a portion of the stock being located outside of the survey domain and the stock being more concentrated in one area (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-range-var-est)). For Yellowtail Flounder, the lowest range was estimated in the Winter at `r range.winter.yt.mn.ci` km with the Spring and Fall range estimates being higher and somewhat more variable than the Winter range estimate. The range estimates of Yellowtail Flounder throughout the year were smaller and less variable than that observed with Atlantic Cod (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-range-var-est)). The uncertainty of these estimates precludes any statistical differences being observed between the seasons.

The standard deviation of the random field was lower for Atlantic Cod in the Winter and Spring than during the Fall (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-sd-var-est)). The significant increase in the standard deviation in the Fall was related to the increased influence of the random field (i.e. the relatively small effect of the environmental covariates) during this season for Atlantic Cod. The standard deviation of the random field is highest for Yellowtail Flounder in the Winter and the seasonal differences for Yellowtail Flounder are smaller than those observed with Atlantic Cod (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-sd-var-est)). The standard deviation of the Yellowtail Flounder field is higher than Atlantic Cod in the Winter and Spring, but lower in the Fall (Figure \@ref(fig:hyper-sd-var-est)).

The posteriors of these hyperparameters for both stocks in the Winter, Spring, and Fall are provided in Figures \@ref(fig:hyper-cod-winter-post) - \@ref(fig:hyper-yt-fall-post).

## Validation

The 5-fold cross validation indicated that each of the models used for 5-fold cross validation (intercept only, SST (Atlantic Cod), DEP (Yellowtail Flounder), and DEP + SST) were able to predict the distribution for both stocks without an increase in bias or a loss of accuracy (Figure \@ref(fig:folds)). The mean error of the residuals for the validation training set predictions were similar to the error from the predicted test data and while the mean error of the test data was generally more variable, the estimates were centred on 0 and thus there was no evidence of bias in these predictions (Figure \@ref(fig:folds)). The RMSE from the test and training data showed similar patterns for both stocks and most of the models, although for Yellowtail Flounder the RMSE for both the training and test data from the intercept only model was slightly lower than either of the models with covariates indicating that the inclusion of the environmental covariates may result in a small loss of out-of-sample prediction (Figure \@ref(fig:folds)).

The flexibility of the random fields alone (intercept models) indicated that from a predictive standpoint the random fields were often able to predict the OP without a substantial loss of predictive ability when compared to the more complex models including the static environmental data (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:folds)). This occurred because the random fields are flexible enough to capture the variability inherent in the data in each era, while the environmental covariate relationships were constrained to be invariant throughout the entire time series. Recent research suggests that using a static random field in conjunction with a spatio-temporal random field may provide less biased and more accurate estimates than models that rely on environmental covariates [@yinPrepSpatiotemporalModel2019].
